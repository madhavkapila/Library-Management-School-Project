# Library-Management-School-Project
This is a CLI Library Management Project I created as a part of my senior secondary school evaluations using Python and SQL


## About The Project
Books play a quintessential role in everyone’s life by introducing them to a world of imagination, providing knowledge of the outside world, improving their reading, writing and speaking skills as well as boosting memory and intelligence. The importance of books in our life cannot be undermined for they not only help in broadening our horizons but also act as doorways to connecting us with the world around us. They function as survival kits, they influence us and leave an impact on us.

A LIBRARY is the best and most accessible place to find books. However, libraries have so many volumes and so many people regularly borrow books from them that the need for library management arises.
Therefore, thanks to the very broad curriculum offered by CBSE, which gives us the option to select from a variety of topic combinations, I am fortunate enough to select a subject that interests me: INFORMATICS PRACTICES. But if information is not put to use for someone's advantage, it is of no use. So I argued, why not use my understanding of PYTHON AND MYSQL to develop a resource/facility of LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM for the benefit of LIBRARIES who wish to use this System that is very easy to use and operates on wide variety of platforms.

### AUTOMATED LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

This system enables automatic library management in educational institutions like schools, colleges, and coaching facilities. The automated library management system's main advantages are cost savings and increased output. All library operations can be readily maintained by the librarians. Broadly expressed, this system facilitates maintaining a log of all book transactions that take place in the library.
IMPORTANACE OF LIBRARY MANAGEMENT
The library management system is designed to contribute well-management of library functions. It offers ease to perform day to day library operations electronically. This practice being many advantages like;
    • Simple and easy to operate
    • Increase librarian’s efficiencies
    • Mobile access, anytime, anywhere
    • Search, add, update, and view library materials online
    • Helps to manage library functions constructively
    • Saves time and reduces overheads
    • Reduce library’s operating cost
    • Customized reports for better management
    • Remove manual processes to issue books and maintain records
